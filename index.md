###### My favourite character

# DEATH

DEATH is a recurring character in the Discworld book series authored
by Terry Pratchett. He reflects the mythological character of, well,
death. I like DEATH for his determinism, his calm sense of duty, and
most of all, his voice. DEATH only speaks in CAPITAL LETTERS. This
typographical twist is really haunting and the author creates a very
special sensation in the heads of his readers.
